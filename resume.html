The generation of phospholipase A and hemolytic fatty acids by autolysing suspensions of Trypanosoma congolense.<br>
<br>
Tizard IR, Mellors A, Holmes WL, Nielsen K.<br>
Tropenmed Parasitol 1978 Mar;29(1):127-33<br>
<br>
When T. congolense undergoes autolysis there is a concomitant appearance of phospholipase A activity and hemolytic fatty acids. The generation of enzyme activity is exponential, and the appearance of hemolytic activity corresponds to a free fatty acid concentration of 0.02 to 0.03 mg. per ml. The concentration of the trypanosome suspension markedly affected the kinetics of the generation process. In contrast, the autolysis of T. lewisi did not generate hemolytic activity unless exogenous phospholipase A was added to the organisms.<br>

The generation and identification of the hemolysin of Trypanosoma congolense.<br>
<br>
Tizard IR, Holmes WL, York DA, Mellors A.<br>
Experientia 1977 Jul 15;33(7):901-2	<br>
<br>
The hemolytic activity of Trypanosoma congolense appears to be due to the presence of free fatty acids generated by the action of phospholipase A on endogenous phosphatidyl choline. Some lysolecithin also contributes to the lytic activity. Trypanosoma lewisi, being devoid of phospholipase A, does not generate free fatty acids and is therefore non-hemolytic.<br>
